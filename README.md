# BC-OpenAI-Integration

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for "BC-OpenAI-Integration," an innovative solution integrating Dynamics 365 Business Central with OpenAI's API. This project showcases an alternative to using Azure OpenAI, allowing direct communication with OpenAI for generating and managing number series within the ERP system.

## Features
- Direct connection setup between Business Central and OpenAI.
- Generate number series for Warehouse Setup directly through OpenAI's powerful AI models.
- Customizable parameters for fine-tuning AI responses.

## Components
- Codeunit "Generate Series with OpenAI": Orchestrates the series generation process using OpenAI.
- Codeunit "GPT OpenAI": Handles the API calls and responses from OpenAI.
- Other supporting codeunits and objects for seamless integration and operation within Business Central.

## Usage
To connect Business Central to OpenAI, set up the API keys and endpoints in the provided setup table, then use the provided actions and prompts within the ERP to generate and apply number series.

## Additional Notes
This is my initial foray into integrating Business Central with the world of AI. As technology rapidly evolves, the possibilities for using OpenAI in various ERP scenarios expand. While this project is simple, it opens the door for future innovative applications beyond number series generation. I'm open to feedback and further development and hope to see direct OpenAI connections become a standard feature of Business Central in the future.
